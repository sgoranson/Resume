## Bio (Short Format)
Stephen Goranson is an independent researcher focused on symbolic cognition, affective signal processing, and systems-layer narrative structures in human-computational interaction. His work explores how metaphor, tone, and resonance act as tools for navigating higher-order causal systems. He draws from experience in software engineering, theoretical modeling, and interdisciplinary cognitive science.

## Author Description (for Preprint Submissions)
Stephen Goranson studies cognitive resonance phenomena and symbolic encoding strategies in natural and artificial systems. With a background in software engineering and systems theory, his current focus is on how metaphor, tone, and narrative density function as navigational tools in complex perceptual environments. He publishes independently and maintains an open-access presence on GitHub.
